# Textbased-RPG
C# Workshop
Centralized location for community members to view current progress of workshop. 

# Purpose
Learning how to program can be daunting. This workshop aims to make things a bit more enjoyable in the form of building a basic text-based RPG game. 
Here we focus on the fundamentals of programming versus learning a framework such as Unity. 

# Important to note
Some workshops will purposely use a less than ideal approach to later showcase how to refactor existing code as you'd see in industry. Also, it helps to know
what the less-than-ideal approach looks like in order to truly appreciate the improved method of doing things. 

# Community
Not only will we go over certain topics deemed important by the presenter(s), but as a community feel free to ask for things you'd like to see on the [project board](https://github.com/DeVry-Developer-Club/Textbased-RPG/projects/1)! 
Please remember, this is a text-based RPG... so if your suggestion/request is outside of our scope feel free to post your request under our 
[community board](https://github.com/orgs/DeVry-Developer-Club/projects/1)!
